                <p class="text-med-black">Mukayese is built by a team of Natural Language Processing researchers working on
                        <a href="https://tdd.ai" class="blue-text" target="_blank">Turkish Data Depository</a>. Mukayese aims to make AI research
                        reproducible and easily accessible by providing an extensive set of benchmarking tools and datasets for tasks ranging from 
                        spell-checking to natural language understanding. We provide the opportunity for the NLP researchers to view a curated and self-reported list of 
                        both the current state-of-the-art and the most impactful models alongside their respective papers and open-source implementations. 
                        Through this, we aspire to create a reference platform for all Turkish Natural Language Processing researchers worldwide.</p>
                <p class="text-med-black">With Mukayese, we want to standardize the process of
                    evaluating the performance of models for a task on datasets from different distributions and help the performance comparison with the literature. 
                    Comparing a new method with other existing approaches is an essential component of
                    research and this process has traditionally been affected by difference in evaluation
                    metric implementation, different splits of the dataset or minor modifications in the
                    algorithm. This makes it extremely hard to reproduce numbers from published papers
                    and reliably compare your method with other existing approaches. By building Mukayese, we
                    hope to make this easier by standardizing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics and by
                    maintaining a public leaderboard of hosted challenges.</p>
